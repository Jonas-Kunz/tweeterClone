# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This repository is the starter code for the project: Students will fork and clone this repository, then build upon it to practice their HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and their Node, Express back-end skills.

## Getting Started

1. [Create](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) a new repository using this repository as a template.
2. Clone your repository onto your local device.
3. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command.
3. Start the web server using the `npm run local` command. The app will be served at <http://localhost:8080/>.
4. Go to <http://localhost:8080/> in your browser.

## Jonas' Note

I made this project for Lighthouse Labs. I had a fun time learning about how all we've learned so far comes together in a SPA. I particularly enjoyed the aha moments I had about function modularization and seeing the way the server starter code was built was interesting after TinyApp

## Credit

As I am sure most people do, I got a lot of help from searching through google for quicker solutions or easier ways to do things. I also recieved a lot of help from the mentors at Lighthouse Labs and learned a lot through my discussions with them.
